# [SIP-48] Clawback any unclaimed and unemitted Legacy Platform and ILMv1 related rewards to the Seamless DAO treasury

## Summary

Following the successful adoption of [\[GP-9\] Maximizing Borrower Value: Why the Move to Morpho Matters](https://snapshot.box/#/s:seamlessprotocol.eth/proposal/0x901e2aed03877d64a0414496f69b7febb76272cf4a1526c6d3b8813dac455074), this proposal seeks DAO approval for the onchain return of unclaimed and unemitted rewards from the Legacy Platform and ILM v1 to the Seamless DAO treasury. By clawing back rewards, these funds will be available and reused for future governance-approved initiatives.


## Context and motivation

With the approval of GP-9, the Seamless DAO officially entered its “platformless” era – transitioning away from its legacy Aave-based architecture and moving toward building Vaults on Morpho. This transition allows Seamless contributors to prioritize innovation and product development — most recently demonstrated by the launch of [Leverage Tokens](https://app.seamlessprotocol.com/#/?tab=LeverageTokens).

A key aspect of GP-9 was the structured sunsetting of the Legacy Platform, executed in four clearly defined phases, culminating on June 30, 2025.

As part of this wind-down, users were made aware of this transition and were provided with ~3 months to claim any rewards earned via Legacy Platform activity and ILM v1 participation.
Per GP-9, any rewards remaining unclaimed or unemitted past this date are to be returned to the Seamless DAO for future use:

Returning these unclaimed and unemitted rewards requires an explicit onchain execution step, which this proposal seeks to facilitate.

This proposal seeks DAO approval for the following action:
- Execute an onchain transaction that returns any unclaimed and unemitted rewards associated with the Legacy Platform and ILM v1 programs back to the Seamless DAO treasury.
