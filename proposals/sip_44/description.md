# [SIP-44] Protocol Rewards Refresh Q2 2025

## Summary

This proposal seeks to extend platform reward emissions beyond their current end date of March 31, 2025 through Q2 2025 (April 1 - June 30). The proposal maintains our quarterly cadence while preserving monthly flexibility for adjustments. The total budget of 2 million SEAM will be sourced from the short governor timelock and master emissions vesting contracts.

The proposed quarterly reward allocations are:

1. **Seamless Vaults & Leverage Tokens (625,000 SEAM)**
   - Incentivize growth of Seamless Vaults on Morpho
   - Support upcoming launch of [Leverage Tokens](https://x.com/SeamlessFi/status/1902451468415987889)

2. **Legacy Lending Platform (625,000 SEAM)** 
   - Primarily distributed as esSEAM to incentivize long-term alignment
   - Maintain competitive yields for lenders and borrowers

3. **Safety Module (375,000 SEAM)**
   - Encourage protocol security through staking incentives
   - Strengthen alignment between token holders and protocol safety

4. **Strategic Growth Reserve (375,000 SEAM)**
   - Flexible budget for emerging opportunities
   - Usage subject to community approval via Snapshot vote

## Context and Motivation

This proposal aligns with our broader token emissions strategy outlined [here](https://seamlessprotocol.discourse.group/t/gp-7-expanding-protocol-reward-categories-increasing-token-emission-budget-for-seamless/605). The key drivers for continuing emissions are:

1. **Market Timing:** The current macro environment and crypto market sentiment create an opportune moment to accelerate growth and capture market share through strategic token emissions.

2. **Product Evolution:** Our expanding product suite - including new markets, ILMs, and innovative offerings - requires competitive incentives to drive initial adoption and sustainable usage.

3. **Strategic Token Utilization:** With approximately 55% of token supply [reserved for rewards](https://docs.seamlessprotocol.com/governance/seam-tokenomics), front-loading emissions during this growth phase allows us to:
   - Maximize market presence and TVL capture
   - Establish Seamless as the premier lending platform on Base
   - Build toward sustainable fee generation and token value accrual
   - Create a framework for gradual emissions reduction over time

The reward schedules will be implemented based on recommendations from ecosystem partners and contributors. While this represents a maximum quarterly budget, actual emissions may be lower based on market conditions and performance metrics.
