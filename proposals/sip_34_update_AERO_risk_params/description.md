# [SIP-34] Update AERO Risk Parameters

## Summary

Proposal to increase AERO's liquidation threshold and LTV on Seamless lending pool.

## Context and motivation

The Seamless Community (shoutout to Sean from YieldSchool) has noted that Seamless parameters for the AERO market are conservative as compared to other Base DeFi platforms. As such, the Seamless community is requesting a re-review and refresh of key AERO parameters, specifically LTV and LT.

### Chaos Labs Recommendations

| Asset | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| AERO  | 30%         | 67.5%           | 40%        | 72.5%          |
