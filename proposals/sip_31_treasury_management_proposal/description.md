# [SIP-31] Treasury Management Proposal

## Summary

Initiate fourth round of funding for the Aera vault which manages some of the Seamless DAO treasury. This round of funding is for 2.5 million SEAM.

## Context and motivation

Per the [GP-6 Treasury Management Proposal](https://seamlessprotocol.discourse.group/t/gp-6-treasury-management-proposal/276/1), an Aera Vault has been deployed with the intention to manage Seamless DAO’s SEAM treasury.

Additionally, per the outcome of the [Aera Vault Management Council (AVMC) nomination process](https://snapshot.org/#/seamlessprotocol.eth/proposal/0x4ff6c0dad0b1b8e69a130747b2143f04f2e2d4d9f1a2bb1e7ab89749d5e124de), a multisig has been setup as a temporary steward of the Aera Vault.

This onchain proposal will fund the AVMC multisig with DAO SEAM, in order for it to be deposited into the Aera Vault and managed in accordance with the agreed upon mandate/scope of **GP-6**. Upon proper setup, the default plan is for the DAO governor to take over ownership of the vault.

Seamless DAO Aera Vault Address: [0x6ad1F34a382bb81C054FbCE66e18bd5229255f04](https://basescan.org/address/0x6ad1F34a382bb81C054FbCE66e18bd5229255f04)

AVMC Multisig Address: [0x0ec9a61BD923CBaF519b1bAEF839617f012344E2](https://basescan.org/address/0x0ec9a61BD923CBaF519b1bAEF839617f012344E2)

For details around multisig and vault addresses, the confirmations can be found in the GP-6 discourse discussion link, linked above.

Note: This represents the **fourth** transfer of SEAM for the Aera Vault Treasury management purposes, future transfers in accordance with the mandate will occur and require onchain governance action to execute as well.

Past transfers:
1. SIP-10
2. SIP-20
3. SIP-24
